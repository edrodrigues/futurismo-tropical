        <h3>Exponential Thinking</h3>
        <p>Exponential thinking is a mindset that recognizes and leverages the power of exponential growth. It's about understanding that progress doesn't happen in a straight line, but rather accelerates over time, leading to explosive and often disruptive change.</p>
        <button class="read-more">Saiba Mais</button>
        <div class="expanded-content">
          <p>Here are some key characteristics of exponential thinking:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Understanding Doubling:</strong> Recognizing the deceptive nature of early exponential growth. Small initial numbers may seem insignificant, but they can quickly lead to massive results as doublings accumulate.</li>
            <li><strong>Long-Term Vision:</strong> Thinking beyond incremental improvements and envisioning future possibilities that may seem outlandish today.</li>
            <li><strong>Embracing Disruption:</strong> Recognizing that industries and systems can be radically transformed by exponential technologies and being willing to challenge existing assumptions.</li>
            <li><strong>Embracing Risk and Experimentation:</strong> Understanding that failure is a crucial element of innovation and being willing to experiment and iterate quickly to drive progress.</li>
            <li><strong>Thinking at Scale:</strong> Considering the potential impact of exponential technologies on a global scale and aiming to solve problems that affect billions of people.</li>
          </ul>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Exponential Technologies</h3>
        <p>Exponential technologies are those that are rapidly accelerating in performance and capability, typically doubling in power every 12 to 24 months, while simultaneously decreasing in cost. This acceleration is largely driven by Moore's Law, which observes the consistent doubling of transistors on a microchip every 18 months.</p>
